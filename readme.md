Gameful BuddyPress Plugin
-------------------------

This is the Gameful plugin used to perform the several tasks. It depends on 
having [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org/). It is to be used in conjuction 
with the [Gameful Wordpress Theme](https://github.com/natron/Gameful-Theme). 

The plugin can probably be combined with the theme to make a singe atomic
entity. 

The plug-in performs the following functions.

Leveling
========
The majority of the plug-in handles the interaction with 
[the mayor](http://gameful.org/mayor/). The levels, rules and completion are 
all in the plug-in.

Donation Message
================
We hooked into the BuddyPress and [Cubepoints](http://cubepoints.com/) and
created the ability to send a message when you donate points. This ended up
in the plug-in as well.

Gameful Theme
=============
See the Gameful Theme for more info on the dependencies needed to run the plug-in.
